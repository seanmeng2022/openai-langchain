The Nimbus framework provides cloud services to Israeli government ministries—including local municipalities, government-owned companies, and public sector organizations—with the aim of driving innovation and enabling new digital services for the citizens of Israel. “We are excited to welcome the new AWS Region to Israel as part of project Nimbus and we congratulate AWS for its commitment and hard work in building the Israeli Region,” said Yali Rothenberg, accountant general of Israel. “The establishment of the Israeli Region reflects the long-term commitment of AWS to Israel and to the continuation of their large investments in the Israeli market. The establishment of the Region will enable us to migrate substantial governmental workloads to the cloud, and we are confident that it will help us accelerate digital transformation in the public sector, leverage technology to drive innovation in the government, improve customer experience, and further the development of the technological ecosystem in Israel.”\\rWith the launch of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region, AWS has 102 Availability Zones across 32 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand.' metadata={'source': 'Israel.txt'}\n"

      "page_content='AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. The AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region consists of three Availability Zones, each located far enough from the other to support customers’ business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance. The launch of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region enables customers to securely store data in Israel while providing customers with even lower latency across the country to drive greater productivity, more efficient business operations, and enhanced real-time application performance. Customers also have access to advanced AWS technologies to accelerate innovation, including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). AWS released an economic impact study estimating the company’s projected spend on the construction and operation of the new AWS Region, which will support an average of more than 7,700 full-time equivalent jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned $7.2 billion (approx.' metadata={'source': 'Israel.txt'}\n"
